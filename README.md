# bilderrahmen-msp17

## Project description

The project *'Ich-Zeig-Dir-Was'-Bilderrahmen* was a project solved by 15 master students of the [Hochschule Mannheim - University of Applied Sciences](https://www.hochschule-mannheim.de) during 6 weeks. The goal of the project was to create a system which connects members of a family which are living separated from each other on different places. This is achieved by providing a possibility to watch picture galleries together. Each party uses a tablet, one party can swipe through the pictures and the swypes are getting synched on all other devices, so each device always shows the same picture. The system consists of 3 different parts which are listed in the section 'Sub projects'.

## Sub projects

The system consists of the following sub projects. To successfully run it, it is recommended to check out all of these:

## Project description

The project *'Ich-Zeig-Dir-Was'-Bilderrahmen* was a project solved by 15 master students of the [Hochschule Mannheim - University of Applied Sciences](https://www.hochschule-mannheim.de) during 6 weeks. The goal of the project was to create a system which connects members of a family which are living separated from each other in different places. This is achieved by providing a possibility to watch pictures together. Each party uses a tablet or smartphone, one party can swipe through the pictures and the swipes are getting synchronized on all other devices, so each device always shows the same picture. The system consists of multiple different parts which are listed in the section 'Sub projects'.

## Sub projects

The system consists of the following sub projects. To successfully run it, it is recommended to check out all of these:

- [Ionic-App](https://github.com/informatik-mannheim/MSP17-bilderrahmen-ionicapp)
- [Webapp](https://github.com/informatik-mannheim/MSP17-bilderrahmen-webapp)
- [Backend](https://github.com/informatik-mannheim/MSP17-bilderrahmen-backend)
